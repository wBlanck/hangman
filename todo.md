ideas

- search for new api key with more common words
- add a loader, only render elements when fetched random word is complete
- store api key safely (watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDwhJNbWka0)
- keep score, if guessed right generate new word and keep score
- start screen
- max chars in word 15 ish, if more fetch another word
