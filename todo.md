ideas

- store api key safely (watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDwhJNbWka0)
- add a loader, only render elements when fetched random word is complete
- start screen
- keep score, if guessed right generate new word and keep score
- max chars in word 15 ish, if more fetch another word
- show the correct word when lost
- fix mobile screen (display, title etc)
- change location.reload()
- animated buttons to flip around when clicked instead of showing a color
